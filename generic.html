																<h2><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h2>

								<p align= "justify">Wilzin containing zinc acetate, is an effective new weapon in the treatment of Wilson’s Disease. As Zinc Acetate is economical and least toxic, it is vital alternative to chelating agents like Penicillamine & Trientine Hydrochloride..</p>
<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b><br> </p>
<p align= "justify"> Zinc acetate is a salt of zinc used to inhibit the absorption of copper in patients with Wilson’s disease.  Of all the zinc salts, zinc acetate is the least irritant.<br>
<p><b>MODE OF ACTION & PHARMACOKINETICS</b></p>
<p align="justify">Zinc in wilzin induces the intestinal cells to produce a protein called “Metallothinein” which has very high affinity for copper along with them for elimination in the stool.  This means that any newly ingested copper does not reach the circulatory system.
	Zinc treatment is effective over long period of time, even life time and poses no major side-effect.  Wilzin is well tolerated and is essential for adequate control of copper levels.</p>
<p><b>DOSE & ADMINISTRATION</b><br></p>
<p align="justify">The recommended oral dose of Wilzin for adults is 50mg three times a day.  In children 10 years of age or older, or in women who are pregnant, 25mg t.i.d. as effective dose, as long as the patient is compliant with the therapy.  The dose can be raised to 50mg t.i.d. if monitoring indicates a lessening of copper control. <b>Wilzin should be taken either one hour before food or two to three hours after food.  Some patients who take the morning dose (if taken before food) may develop nausea and or gastric disturbances and hence they may take the dose, 2 hours after beak fast.</b></p>
<p><b>DRUG INTERACTION</b><br></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Zinc interferes with absorption of Penicillamine </b>and it is advisable to take wilzin and penicillamine at least 2 hours apart in the case of patients who are on both the drugs. If the patient is taking quinoline (eg: Ciprofloxacin) or tetracycline (eg: doxycycline), it is advisable to <b>separate the doses of wilzin and these drugs at at least by 2 hours.</b></p>
<p><b>INDICATIONS</b><br></p>
<p align="justify">Wilzin is indicated in wilson’s disease as maintenance therapy in patients who have undergone initial treatment with a chelating agent.  Wizlin can be taken by pregnant women and even younger children, though there is little date on its use in children under 5 year of age. For pregnant women, this means wilzin can be taken without dosage reduction in all trimesters of pregnancy. There has been no evidence of increases in the risk of foetal abnormalities with its use.  Wilzin can be used, long-term, in place of non-tolerable chealting agents and can therefore, be a major weapon to fight this rare, otherwise progressive illness.<br><br>Wilzin is indicated in people who are pre-symptomatic, for example siblings of wilson’s disease patients who have 25% changes of developing the disease themselves.</p>
<p><b>CONTRA-INDICATIONS</b><br></p>
<p align="justify">Wilzin is contra-indicated in conditions where Amiloride is in use.  Amiloride could reduce zinc excretion leading to accumulation of zinc which could cause toxic side effects. Wilzin should be avoided in breast-feeding as zinc is excreted in breast milk.  Because of potential risk to the infants, breast-feeding while taking the drug is not recommended.</p>
<p><b>ADVERSE EFFECTS</b><br></p>
<p align="justify">Clinical experience with zinc acetate has been limited. The following adverse reactions have been reported in patients with Wilson’s disease on zinc therapy: Gastric irritation & nausea.</p>

							<h2>What is Wilson's Disease?</h2>
							<p align="justify">Wilson disease is an inherited disorder in which excessive amounts of copper accumulate in the body, particularly in the liver, brain, and eyes. The signs and symptoms of Wilson disease usually first appear between the ages of 6 and 45, but they most often begin during the teenage years. The features of this condition include a combination of liver disease and neurological and psychiatric problems.</p>
